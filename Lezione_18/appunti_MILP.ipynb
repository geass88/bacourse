    "In this topic, you’ll learn how to deal with integer decision variables by using Integer Programming and Mixed-Integer Programming, and how these techniques differ from LP.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problems requiring integers\n",
    "\n",
    "For some optimization problems the decision variables should take integer values. \n",
    "\n",
    "- One example is problems involving the production of large indivisible items, such as airplanes or cars.  It usually does not make sense to use a continuous variable to represent the number of airplanes to produce, because there is no point in manufacturing a partial airplane, and each finished airplane involves a large cost.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Another example of where one would use integer variables is to model a particular state, such as on or off. For example, a unit commitment problem where integer variables are used to represent the state of a particular unit being either on or off.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Planning of investments also requires integer variables, for example a variable that takes a value of 1 to invest in a warehouse, and 0 to ignore it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, integer variables are often used to model logic between different decision, for example that a given tax break is only applicable if a certain investment is made.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Different types of integer decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "Many types of decisions can be modeled by using integer variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "One example is yes/no decisions, with a value of 1 for yes, and 0 for no. For example, if x equals 1, new manufacturing equipment should be installed, and if x equals 0, it should not. \n",
    "\n",
    "Integer variables are also used to model state or mode decisions. For example, if z1 equals 1 the machine operates in mode 1, if z2 equals 1, the machine operates in mode 2, and if z3 equals 1 the machine operates in mode 3.  The same integer is often used to express both yes/no decisions and logic. For example, y1 equals 1 could in this case also be used to indicate that machine 1 is installed, and 0 otherwise. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, integer variables are used tomodel cases where a value can take only integer values: for example: how many flights should a company operate between two airports.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of integer variables\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, integer variables can take any integer value, such as 0, 1, 2, 3, and so forth.  Integers that should only take the values of 1 or 0 are known as binary (or Boolean) variables. Binary variables are also often referred to as Boolean variables because the Boolean values of true and false are analogous to 1 and 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that an integer variable can only take the values 0 and 1, one can give it an upper bound of 1 or declare it to be of type binary. In a DOcplex  model, decision variables are assumed to be nonnegative unless otherwise specified and the lower bound of 0 does not need to be declared explicitly. "

    "\n",
    "Integer and binary variables are very useful to express logical constraints. Here are a few examples of\n",
    "such constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indicator variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Indicator variables are binary variables used to indicate whether a certain set of conditions is valid (with the variable equal to 1) or not (with the variable equal to 0). For example, consider a production problem where you want to distinguish between two states, namely production above a minimum threshold, and no production. \n",
    "\n",
    "To model this, define a binary variable $y$ to take a value of 1 if the production is above the minimum threshold (called minProd), and 0 if there is no production. Assume $production$ is a continuous variable containing the produced quantity. \n",
    "This leads to these two constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "production \\ge minProd \\cdot y\\\\\n",
    "production \\le maxProd \\cdot y\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, maxProd is an upper bound on the production quantity. Thus, if y = 1, the minimum and maximum production bounds hold, and if y = 0, the production is set to zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logical constraints - an example\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider an investment decision involving a production plant and two warehouses. \n",
    "\n",
    "- If the production plant is invested in, then either warehouse 1 or warehouse 2 may be invested in (not both).\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the production plant is not invested in, then neither of the two warehouses may be invested in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $yPlant$ be 1 if you decide to invest in the production plant, and 0 otherwise. \n",
    "Similar for $yWarehouse1$ and $yWarehouse2$.\n",
    "Then this example can be modeled as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "yWarehouse1 + yWarehouse2 \\leq yPlant\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $yPlant$ is 0 then both $yWarehouse1$ and $yWarehouse2$ are set to zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the opposite, if one warehouse variable is set to 1, then $yPlant$ is also set to 1. Finally, this constraint also states that warehouse variables cannot be both equal to 1.\n"
