    "## Esercizio 50: Multi-Plant, Multi-Item, Multi-Period Capacitated Lot-Sizing Problem without Inter-Plant Transfers\n",
    "\n",
    "We discuss about a practical problem observed in a large steel corporation in United States of America with $m$ manufacturing units/plants located in different parts of the country.  Each plant has different production technology/equipment and can produce all the products.  Due to the differences in technology, the production cost/time, setup cost/time were different at different plants.  Now the production planning problem for multiple plants is required to address these issues:\n",
    "- Products to be produced in each plant and their quantities,\n",
    "- Inventory of products to be carried at the end of each period at each plant and their quantities,\n",
    "- <font color=\"red\"><S>Products to be transferred from one plant to another and their quantities.</S></font>\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem consists of determining the production and inventory levels of a set $N = \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ of items, to be produced in a set $P= \\{1, \\dots, m\\}$ of plants over a set $T= \\{1, \\dots, \\ell\\}$ of time periods. Moreover, items cannot be transferred between plants in each period. A mathematical model is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\min     \\quad          &\\sum_{i\\in N} \\sum_{j \\in P} \\sum_{t \\in T} \\left( c_{ijt}x_{ijt} + s_{ijt}y_{ijt} + h_{ijt}I_{ijt} \\right)  & &\\\\\n",
    " \\mathrm{s.t.} \\quad& I_{ij(t-1)} + x_{ijt} - I_{ijt} = d_{ijt} & i \\in N, j \\in P, t \\in T  &\\qquad (1)\\\\\n",

    "In this formulation, each triplet $(i,j,t)$, $i \\in N$, $j \\in P$, $t \\in T$ is characterized by a demand $d_{ijt}$, a production time $b_{ijt}$, a setup time $g_{ijt}$, a unit production cost $c_{ijt}$, a setup cost $s_{ijt}$, and a unit inventory cost $h_{ijt}$. Moreover, a parameter $C_{jt}$ represents the production capacity of plant $j$ in period $t$. The decision variables are $x_{ijt}$, the quantity of item $i$ produced at plant $j$ in period $t$; $I_{ijt}$, the inventory level of item $i$ at plant $j$ at the end of the period $t$; $y_{ijt}$, a binary variable that equals $1$ if and only if item $i$ is produced at plant $j$ in period $t$. \n",
